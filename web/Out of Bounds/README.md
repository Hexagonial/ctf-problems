## Description (wip)
I really HATE game developers. So much so that when I receive a new game, my priority is not to beat the game, but to find out how to go to places I'm not supposed to. I made a cool guide on several video games with out-of-bounds glitches which you can find here (linked). Do you have any additions to recommend??
